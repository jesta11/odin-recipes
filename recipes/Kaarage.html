    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Kaarage is a frying and unique Japanese cooking technique. Most people think of kaarage as being fried chicken. This might be the most common way
        but kaarage can be applied to fish or vegetable as well. For today we will be focused on making chicken kaarage.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lb boneless, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt </li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Potato starch or corn starch</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups neutral-flavoured oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Seasonings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 knob ginger</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp Sake</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch pieces and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Grate the ginger</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, and sesame oil. Whisk it all together</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the bowl and mix it with your hands. Cover and keep in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot and heat to 325F on medium heat</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the potato starch and all-purpose flour in separate piles</li>
        <li>First, lightly dredge each marinated chicken piece in the flour and dust off the excess flour. Then, dredge it in the potato starch and remove the excess starch.</li>
        <li>Continue with the remaining pieces</li>
        <li>First Deep-Frying: Deep-fry for 90 seconds, or until the outside of the chicken is a light golden color. 
            If the chicken browns too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. 
            Controlling the oil temperature at all times is very important for deep-frying. Transfer the chicken pieces to a wire rack to drain the excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken as it rests on the wire rack. Continue deep-frying the remaining chicken pieces. 
            Between batches, pick up and discard the crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from becoming darker.
        </li>
        <li>Second Deep-Frying: Now, heat the oil to 350ºF (177ºC). Place 3 to 5 pieces of the resting chicken back into the oil and deep-fry for 45 seconds, 
            or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to a wire rack to drain the excess oil. Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
    </ol>
