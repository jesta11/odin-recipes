    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients</li> 
    </ol>
    <h4>To make the Hambugu Patties</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mince the onion finely: Lay the half onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end, 
            make ¼-inch (6 mm) vertical slices to within ½ inch (1.3 cm) of the root end. 
            Next, with the knife's edge toward the root, make ¼-inch (6 mm) horizontal slices, again keeping the root end intact.</li>
        <li>Then, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices you made. To chop the onions finer you can run your knife through them using a rocking motion. 
            Be sure to hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions will go flying around the room.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat and add the onions</li>
        <li>Saute the onions until tender and almost translucent. Transfer to a large bowl and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are cool, add the ground beef and pork to the bowl. Add the salt, black pepper, as you like, and nutmeg</li>
        <li>Add the milk, panko, and egg</li>
        <li>Start mixing it all together with a silicone spatula or spoon</li>
        <li>Then, switch to mixing by hand and knead the mixture until it's sticky and pale.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into quarters (4 oz or 113g each) or six smaller portions. Scoop out one portion</li>
        <li>Toss it from one hand to the other repeatedly about five time in order to release any air inside the mixture.</li>
        <li>Make an oval-shaped and place on a tray or plate. Repeat with the remaining portions. Cover the patties with plastic wrap and keep them
            in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before cooking so that the meat combines well and the fat solidifies
        </li> 
    </ol>
    <h4>To Cook the Hambugu</h4>
    <>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the oil over medium and place the patties gently into the pan. Indent the center of each patty with two fingers
            because the centers will rise with the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the patties until browned on the bottom side, about 3 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook for another 3 minutes until browned</li>
        <li>Add the red wine for steaming the patties and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 5-7 minutes to thoroughly cook the insides
            of the patties (adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of the patties)
        </li>
        <li>Uncover and check that it's done by inserting a skewer; if clear juice comes out, it's done. Increase the heat to medium to let the alcohol finish
            evaporating. When it's almost finished, transfer the hamburg steaks to individual plates. Do not wash the pan as you will make the sauce next using the pants juices
        </li>
    </ol> 
    <h4>To Make the Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same frying pan (without cleansing), add the unsalted butter, ketchup, and tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>Add the water and red wine for the sauce to the pan</li>
        <li>Mix well together and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat; let the alcohol evaporate</li>
        <li>When the sauce thickens(and you can draw a line on the bottom of the frying pan with a spatula), remove from the heat. Drizzle the sauce over
            the hamburger steaks. Pour the leftover sauce in a small bowl or jar and bring it to the table in case anyone wants to add more. We typically serve
            steamed rice, miso soup, and steamed vegetables or a salad with this meal.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To Store</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer the leftover hamburger steaks to an airtight container and let them cool completely. You can store them in the refrigerator for up
            to 3 days and the freezer for up to a month.
        </li>
    </ol>
